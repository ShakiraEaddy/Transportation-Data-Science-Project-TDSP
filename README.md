# Transportation-Data-Science-Project-TDSP-
Worked alongside Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub) to find ways to make roads safer. Used data science methods like cleaning data, time series analysis, and mapping to study traffic patterns and spot risks. Programmed in Python and created visual charts to explain findings in a virtual poster.
