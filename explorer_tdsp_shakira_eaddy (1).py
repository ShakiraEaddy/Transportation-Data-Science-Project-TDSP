## <font color='crimson'>**A Quick Introduction to Google Colab**</font>

Read below for a Google Colab QuickStart:
- Google Colab is a Python Notebook environment built by Google that's free for all.
- Colab Notebooks are made up of cells; cells can be either *text* or *code* cells. You can click the +code or +text button at the top of the Notebook to create a new cell.
- Text cells use a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Knowledge of Markdown is not required for this project. However, if you'd like to learn more, [check out this Cheatsheet!](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- Python code is executed in *code* cells. When you want to run your code, hover your cursor over the square brackets in the top left corner of your code cell. You'll notice a play button pop up! (â–¶) Click the play button to run the code in that cell. Code cells run one at a time.
- The memory shared across your notebook is called the *Runtime*. You can think of a Runtime as a "code session" where everything you create and execute is temporarily stored.
- Runtimes will persist for a short period of time, so you are safe if you need to refresh the page, but Google will shutdown a Runtime after enough time has passed. Everything that you have printed out will remain within your Notebook even if the runtime is disconnected.

If this is your first time using Google Colab, we highly recommend reviewing the [NSDC's *Using Google Colab Guide*](https://nebigdatahub.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NSDC-Data-Science-Projects-Introduction-Using-Google-Colab.pdf) before continuing. For a more comprehensive guide, see [Colab's *Welcome To Colaboratory* walkthrough.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/prites18/NoteNote/blob/master/Welcome_To_Colaboratory.ipynb)

## <font color='crimson'>**An Introduction to Python Programming**</font>

Python is a programming language often used to analyze data.

Python is open-source, which means it's free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes. Python's versatility allows it to be used for web development, data visualization, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

Python's extensive standard library, along with its powerful third-party packages, enable developers and data scientists to perform a vast array of tasks.

For those looking to dive deeper into Python, here are some valuable resources:
- [The Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) â€“ Offers comprehensive guides and reference materials for Python leaners.
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) â€“ Provides tutorials and articles for Python developers of all skill levels.
- [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) â€“ The largest annual gathering for the Python community, which is useful for learning from experts and discovering the latest developments in the Python ecosystem.
- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) â€“ A book and website by Dr. Charles Severance that offers a free course on Python for beginners.

**Let's review some essential Python Functions!**

Here are some key functions you'll frequently encounter:

1. **`head()`**: This function is crucial for getting a quick overview of your dataset. By default, it returns the first five rows, offering a snapshot of your data's structure and values.

2. **`describe()`**: This provides a summary of the statistical characteristics of your dataset. It's particularly useful for gaining insights into the distribution, mean, standard deviation, and range of numerical columns.

3. **`sum()`**: This calculates the total sum of a column or a series of numbers, proving essential for quick calculations and aggregations in data analysis.

4. **`isnull()`**: This helps identify missing or null values in your dataset, allowing for effective data cleaning and preprocessing.

5. **`value_counts()`**: Understanding the frequency of various values in your dataset is a common task in data science. The `value_counts()` function makes this easy by counting the occurrence of each unique value in a column.

Now that you've reviewed these important concepts, let's dive in to the project!

## <font color='crimson'>**Milestone #1 - Data Preparation**</font>
GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to set up your environment, install the required packages, learn how to access data and do some basic exploratory data analysis.

**Step 1:** Setting up libraries and installing packages

A **library** is a collection of code that you can use in your programs, while a **package** is a folder that contains libraries or other packages, organized for easy use.

To install a library, we'll use the following format:
```python
 import <library name> as <shortname>
```
We use a *short name* since it is easier to refer to the package to access functions and also to refer to subpackages within the library. Think of it as a nickname for easier reference!
"""

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import folium

"""These are the libraries that will help us throughout this project. We invite you to research each library for a better understanding.

We encourage you to read more about the important and most commonly used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn and write a few lines in your own words about what they do. [You may use the Data Science Resource Repository (DSRR) to find resources to get started!](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/data-science-resource-repository/)

**TO DO:** Write a few lines about what each library does:




> * Pandas: **Pandas** is one of the most used libraries in Python. It is an open source **data analysis/manipulation tool**. It can **be used to read and write data from different formats** like CSV, Excel, SQL, etc. Panda is also **used to clean, filter, and visualize data.**

> * Matplotlib: **Matplotlib** is a Python library for **creating animated, static, and interactive visuals**. To put it more simply, Matplotlib is used as a plotting library. You **can create plots, charts, histograms, etc.**

> * **Seaborn:** Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and it also integrates with Pandas. It is **a data visualization library**. It lets you **focus more so on what your data means** rather than how they look visually.

**Step 2:** Letâ€™s access our data. We will be using the [NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). According to NYC Open Data, "each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC." If you need a reminder on how to upload your dataset, [please review helpful hints here.](https://nebigdatahub.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NSDC-Data-Science-Projects-Introduction-Using-Google-Colab.pdf)

Since this is a large dataset, we highly recommend that you upload your data by [mounting your Google Drive](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA).

To mount your Google Drive, begin by finding the folder icon on the left side of your screen. When you click on this folder icon, you will open the Files window. Click on the icon at the top of the Files window that says "Mount Drive" as you hover over it.
"""

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

"""Next, we will read the data using the `pd.read_csv` function.
Ensure that you've downloaded the dataset from NYC OpenData, and uploaded the dataset to your Google Drive.

Hint: Your data's file path describes the location of where your data lives. To locate your data's file path, click on the folder/file-shaped icon on the left side of the Notebook. You'll notice a folder labeled "drive." Search for your Motor Vehicle Collisions Dataset within that folder. Right click on your Dataset to "copy path." Paste that path below.
"""

# TODO: Read the data using pandas read_csv function
data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes_20241007.csv')

"""**Step 3:** Let's see what the data looks like. We can use the `head` function which returns the first 5 rows of the dataset."""

# TODO: Print the first 5 rows of the data using head function of pandas
data.head()

# TODO: Describe the data using the describe function of pandas
desc_stats = data.describe()
desc_stats

"""The information above is currently formatted in scientific notation. Need a refresher? [Review how to analyze and convert to and from scientific notation here!](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/scientific-notation.html)

1. Latitude & Longitude: The latitude and longitude indicate where the crashes are occurring. However, there are some data points with latitude and longitude values of 0, which is likely due to missing or inaccurate data.

2. Number of Persons Injured: On average, each crash has around 0.305 injuries. The maximum number of injuries in a single crash is 43.

3. Number of Persons Killed: Fatalities are rare, with an average of 0.00146 deaths per crash. The maximum number of deaths in one crash is 8.

4. Number of Pedestrians, Cyclists, and Motorists Injured/Killed: These columns provide a breakdown of the injuries and fatalities by type of individual involved.

5. Collision ID: This is a unique identifier for each crash.

##<font color='crimson'> **Milestone #2 - Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration** </font>
GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to assess the dataset, find missing values, and decide what to do with those missing data points.

**Step 1:**
Before we begin assessing our data for missing values, it is important that we understand the ethical implications surrounding data processing. To best prepare yourself for this module, review one or more of the following resources:
- [Data Science Ethics Flashcard Video Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNs9ZO9jGtUB7XTjXy-ttoo2QSLld9SrV&feature=shared)
- [What Do I Need to Understand about Data Ethics?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efy8htCDueE)
-[Introduction to Data Cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8WkoGLkdTk)

**TO DO:** Based on the resources above and outside knowledge, what are some potential bias issues related to the availability of data from well-resourced communities as compared to under-resourced communities? How might bias show up in our dataset?

> Answer here: Bias issues related to data from well-resourced and under-resourced communities can greatly affect the accuracy and usefulness of datasets. Under-resourced communities often do not have the means to collect and report data properly, leading to a lack of representation of their needs and incidents. In contrast, well-resourced areas usually have better data collection methods, which can result in over-reporting. This creates sampling bias, where the data mainly reflects the experiences of well-resourced communities and skews the understanding of issues like safety and health. Additionally, the people gathering and analyzing data may have unconscious biases that influence which data is prioritized and how it is interpreted. This can lead to overgeneralization, where conclusions drawn from the data do not apply to under-resourced communities, furthering existing inequalities. Data quality may vary, and issues related to privacy and consent can occur, especially if individuals from under-resourced backgrounds are less aware of their rights. To reduce these biases, it is essential to encourage inclusive data collection, practice ethical methods, promote careful analysis of data, and build trust within communities. By raising awareness of these issues, we can create a fairer approach to data that accurately represents the needs of all communities, especially those that are underserved.

**Step 2:**
Check the dataset for missing values.
"""

import pandas as pd # Import the pandas library
data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes_20241007.csv')
#TODO: Leverage the isnull() and sum() functions to find the number of missing values in each column
missing_values = pd.isnull(data).sum()

#TODO: Turn the missing value counts into percentages
missing_values_percentage = (missing_values / len(data)) * 100

#TODO: Return counts and percentages of missing values in each column
missing_data = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing_values, 'Percentage (%)': missing_values_percentage})
missing_data.sort_values(by='Percentage (%)', ascending=False)

"""Here's an overview of the missing values in the dataset:

Columns like VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5, CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5, VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4, and so on have a high percentage of missing values. This is expected since not all crashes involve multiple vehicles or factors.

OFF STREET NAME and CROSS STREET NAME have significant missing values. This could be due to crashes occurring in locations where these details aren't applicable or weren't recorded.

ZIP CODE, BOROUGH, and ON STREET NAME also have missing values. This might be due to incomplete data entry or crashes occurring in areas where these specifics aren't easily determinable.

LOCATION, LATITUDE, and LONGITUDE have the same count of missing values, indicating that when one is missing, the others are likely missing as well.

**Step 3:** Create a bar chart to display the top 10 contributing factors (e.g. backing up unsafely, unsafe lane changing, etc.) to crashes within the dataset.

"""**TO DO:** What are the top 3 vehicles that were most involved in crashes?


> *   Sedan(s)

> *   Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle(s)

> *   Passenger Vehicle(s)

**TO DO:** Why do you think that "Sedan[s]," "Station Wagon[s]," and "Passenger Vehicle[s]" are involved in a larger number of crashes, injuries, and deaths when compared to the rest of the vehicles? (Think outside the box!)


> *  One of the reasons that "Sedan(s)," "Station Wagon(s)," and "Passenger Vehicle(s)" are involved in a larger number of crashes, injuries, and deaths when compared to the rest of the vehicles is because of how much of those specific types of vehicles there are on the roads in comparison to the other vehicles in the chart. Sedans and passenger cars are some of the most commonly driven vehicles. Because there are so many of them on the roads, they are more likely to be involved in accidents just due to more chances to interact with other vehicles.

**TO DO:** Review the x-axis of the bar chart you created above. </br>
1) What do you notice? </br>
2) What would you recommend we do to improve the bar chart, based on the x-axis (horizontal axis) and why? </br>
3) What recommendation would you make to those who are collecting and/or inputting data into this dataset?


> *  1)  I noticed that "Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle" and "Taxi" are listed twice within the bar chart as separate categories. This causes incorrect data due to those specific vehicle types being *split*. If the two "Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle" categories were together, it would be considered the number one "vehicle type crash" because the two adding up would cause a higher data value than the "Sedan" category. Also, the two "Taxi" categories need to be added together as well within their same category since they represent the same data and vehicle types.

> *  2) I would recommend making the two "Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle" categories be within the same category as well as the two "Taxi" categories be within its same category. Adding the two "Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle" categories together would not only cause a higher data value, but it will also create a more accurate analysis. The same with reason regarding the "Taxi" category.

> *  3) To improve the accuracy of the dataset and ensure clear data representation, I would recommend the following:
<br><b>- Consolidate Categories:</b> Combine the "Station Wagon" and "Sport Utility Vehicle" categories into one category. This will provide a clearer picture of the total incidents involving these types of vehicles, reflecting their combined impact on crash statistics.</br>
<b>- Merge Taxi Categories:</b> Similarly, merge the two "Taxi" categories into a single entry. Since they represent the same type of vehicle, combining them will lead to more accurate data and a better understanding of taxi-related crashes.</br>
<b>- Standardize Definitions:</b> Ensure that there is a clear and consistent definition for each vehicle category. This helps prevent confusion and ensures that similar types of vehicles are grouped together correctly.</br>
<b>- Regular Audits:</b> Conduct regular audits of the data to identify any duplicates or inconsistencies. This can help maintain the integrity of the dataset over time.
<br><b>- Data Visualization:</b> Use visual representations of the data that highlight the importance of merging these categories. Charts or graphs that show combined totals can help stakeholders understand the real impact of these vehicle types.</br>

**Step 5:**  A DataFrame is a two-dimensional and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). DataFrames allow for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in a structured form, serving as the primary data structure for a multitude of data processing tasks. It is used with Python libraries like pandas.

Let's graph the *types* of crashes within this dataset and their frequencies. Begin by aggregating your data, convert to [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) for simple plotting, and plot.

plt.show()

"""**TO DO:** Analyze the chart above. What is a recommendation you might make to the Department of Transportation based on this data?


> *  To reduce the high rate of motorist injuries, the Department of Transportation could focus on enhancing road design, enforcing speed limits, and promoting safe driving practices. Improved lane markings, roundabouts, and protected turn lanes could make high-risk areas safer. Speed control measures, like increased enforcement and public awareness campaigns, would encourage safer driving, while programs addressing fatigue and distracted driving could improve focus.

##<font color='crimson'> **Milestone #3 - Time Series Analysis**</font>
GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to dive deeper into Time Series Analysis in order to better understand our data's trends over time.

**Step 1:**

Before we jump into Time Series Analysis (TSA), it's important to understand the basics, including Trends, Seasonality, and Residual Components.

Review one or more of the following resources and tell us what you learned about TSA!

*  [Learn about Time Series patterns here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/tspatterns.html)
* [Learn about Time Plots here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/time-plots.html)
*[Learn how to decompose Time Series Data into Trend and Seasonality](https://machinelearningmastery.com/decompose-time-series-data-trend-seasonality/)

**TO DO:** Write 3-5 sentences about TSA.
> *  <b>Time series data</b> can show patterns over time, like trends, seasons, and cycles. A trend is a steady rise or fall, while seasonality repeats at a fixed time, such as monthly or yearly. Cycles look like seasonal patterns but donâ€™t follow a fixed schedule and often relate to economic shifts.
A <b>time plot</b> is a useful first graph for time series data, showing observations over time with connected points. Long-term fluctuations are also visible, with periods of increase and decrease.

**Step 2:** Let's begin by creating a chart that displays the average number of crashes per hour of the day. This will help us understand whether additional factors are contributing to crashes - i.e. rush hour, school dismissal time, night fall, etc.

    2.1 Trend: This graph shows the long-term trend in the data, which can indicate whether crashes are increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.

    2.2 Seasonality: This reveals any regular patterns that repeat over a specific period, such as yearly. It helps identify times of the year with higher or lower crash frequencies.

    2.3 Residuals: These are the irregular components that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality. They might include random or unpredictable fluctuations.

**TO DO:** Based on your *trend graph*, are we seeing an increase or a decrease in crashes between 2014 and 2022?

> *  The trend graph shows a steady increase in crashes from 2014 to early 2019, followed by a gradual decline starting in 2019. Toward the end of 2019 and throughout most of 2020, crash numbers dropped sharply. From late 2020 through the end of 2021, crashes rose slightly but then began to decrease again from late 2021 through the first quarter of 2024.


**TO DO:** Based on your *residual graph*, in what year(s) was there a significant unpredicted fluctuation? Why do you think so?

> *  In the residual graph, there was a clear unexpected change at the start of 2014 and an even bigger change at the beginning of 2020. The change in 2014 might point to an unusual event that briefly affected crash numbers, while the change in 2020 likely connects to the start of COVID-19. Due to quarantines and fewer cars on the road, crash numbers dropped more than expected, causing these differences from the trend.

**TO DO:** Are there any reasons that you think a certain borough has a higher or lower number of crashes? What are some factors that may be causing this?

> *  Reasons as to why certain boroughs can have a higher or lower number of crashes can be due to factors such as population. For example, if there is a higher population in Brooklyn than in Staten Island, then the number of crashes can play a big role in why there are more crashes in Brooklyn than in Staten Island.

**Step 2:** Heatmaps are graphical representations that use color coding to represent different values and variables. Let's leverage a heatmap to determine the most dangerous intersections in the dataset. (**Note: the below cell may take a few minutes to run**)

You may initially want to code these incidents by using different colors, but it's important to think about your map and how accessible it is. Will a color-coded map be easy to read for everyone?

##<font color='crimson'>  **Milestone #5 - Self-Guided Research Question**</font>
GOAL: In this Milestone, you will be prompted to take what youâ€™ve learned throughout this project, build your own research question, and create a visualization(s) or model(s) to support your research goals.

You may create your visualization(s) in this Colab Notebook, or in Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, etc. Choose whichever medium you are most comfortable with! Be creative!

For participants who are comfortable with advanced data science techniques, we welcome you to leverage additional datasets, if desired. We highly recommend using pre-cleaned datasets from open data sources, like Kaggle.com.

If you have any questions or get stuck, please email nsdc@nebigdatahub.org with your queries. We're here to help!

**Step 1:** Review the dataset(s) that you will be using. As you explore, [consider the research question you want to answer](https://libraries.indiana.edu/sites/default/files/Develop_a_Research_Question.pdf)! Additionally, think about [who you are telling your data's story to](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data). Your final audience may contain a group of transportation professionals, data scientists, peers, and the general public. Think about how would you frame your analysis differently for each of these groups.

**TO DO:** List one or more research questions here that you are considering.

> *  At what times of day are crashes, injuries, and fatalities most likely to occur, and what trends can be observed across different time periods?

**Step 2:** Now, think about what type of analysis you'd like to complete. Are you interested in looking at time series forecasting? Do you have additional maps in mind that you'd like to create? Is there a certain zip code or region you'd like to dive deeper into?

If you happen to be stuck, here are some examples that you can use or can guide you in choosing your research question!

**Examples:**
- How many crashes, injuries, and/or fatalies occurred in a zip code of interest?
- Which zip code sees the highest amount of crashes and what recommendations can you offer to help that community? Is it an underserved community?
- Do more crashes occur in underrepresented communities? Support your conclusion.
- Which day of the week sees the most crashes, injuries, and/or fatalities? (Hint: use the same method we used when we were analyzing the average number of crashes at different times of the day!)
- Does the geometric features of an intersection (90 degree intersection vs skewed intersection) affect the number of crashes that occur?

Be creative and think outside the box!

**Step 3:** Now that you've decided on your transportation research question, [explore the various types of visualizations you can create to support your research](https://datavizcatalogue.com/). You may create visualizations in this Google Colab notebook, Excel, R, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, etc. Choose a program you are comfortable with!

You may also choose to build a model or leverage a different data science technique based on your experience level.

**Step 4:** Consider the **accessibility** of the graphs, charts, maps, or models you are interested in building. Use the tools below to learn more!
* How does your visualization appear to people [who may not be able to distinguish between muted colors or see your chart at all?](https://chartability.fizz.studio/)
*[Color Contrast Checker](https://policyviz.com/2022/11/01/color-contrast-checker-in-excel/)
*[SAS Graphics Accelerator](https://support.sas.com/software/products/graphics-accelerator/index.html)
*[TwoTone Data Sonification Tool](https://twotone.io/about/)
*[Making Visual Studio Accessible](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility)

To make visualizations more inclusive for people with color blindness, you can choose a color palette that is colorblind-friendly. `Seaborn`, a Python visualization library, provides several palettes that are designed to be perceptible by those with color vision deficiencies. Seaborn's `cubehelix` palette is a good choice, as it was designed specifically with color blindness in mind.

**Step 5:** Begin your research! Give yourself plenty of time to build your visualization or model. If you have any questions along the way, please email nsdc@nebigdatahub.org or write a message in the #[tdsp-community Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/nsdcorps/shared_invite/zt-1h64t1e2p-La0AgU_HhymWUEGFQEcb3w).

**TO DO:** List the research question(s) you've chosen and why! Maybe you chose this question because it can help a community of interest or because it is similar to research you've completed in a class setting. Share your thoughts below.

> * <b>Research Question:</b> At what times of day are crashes, injuries, and fatalities most likely to occur in New York City, and what trends can be observed across different boroughs?

> *  <b>Reason:</b> This research question was chosen to help identify specific time periods with higher crash rates, injuries, and fatalities, which can provide valuable insights for targeted safety interventions. Understanding when crashes are most likely to occur allows transportation departments to provide resources more effectively, such as scheduling enforcement during peak risk hours or adjusting traffic management strategies to reduce accidents. Additionally, identifying these high-risk times can aid in public awareness campaigns, helping to promote safer driving behaviors at critical times, and contributing to improved road safety. This question also emphasizes identifying peak times for crashes and associated injuries or fatalities, while allowing for an analysis of patterns across various times of day.

**TO DO:** Build a visualization, model, or use other statistical methods to gain insights into your data and to support your research question.
